# vim-git-arglist

A plugin which adds helper commands for modifying the arglist based on the
current Git repository.

# Installation

The plugin is plain Vimscript, so the installation doesn't require anything
special. You can install the plugin using whichever plugin manager you normally
use. For example, if you use vim-plug, add:

```
Plug 'joechrisellis/vim-git-arglist'
```
